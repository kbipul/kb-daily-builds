# 90-Day Project Backlog

Rules for the loop (see PLAYBOOK.md Step 1.5 — the selection protocol governs):
- **This is a candidate pool, not a queue.** Each morning: deep signal scan →
  slate (next 2 backlog items + signal-derived ideas) → score /12 → highest
  score builds. Displaced items shift forward; strong losers (≥8) get appended.
- **Days 14, 28, 42, …** are India Flagship days — slate drawn only from the
  India Flagship Pool below.
- `[F]` = flagship (bigger scope, extra polish — these get pinned).
- **Demo:** `pages` = live GitHub Pages demo (client-side AI, no API keys); `byok` = runs locally with user's own Azure/OpenAI key; `cli` = terminal tool, demo = GIF in README.
- Stack default: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Vitest. C#/.NET 8 where marked. CI must pass before publishing.

## Signal-derived candidates (appended by the loop — score ≥8, lost the day)
| Idea | Repo | Scope | Demo | From |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~Token Cost Lab~~ (BUILT day 4, 2026-07-11) | `token-cost-lab` | Client-side tokenizer + live cost comparison across GPT-5.6 (Terra/Luna), Claude Sonnet 5, Grok 4.5 using current July-2026 pricing; paste a prompt, see per-provider cost | pages | Won day 4 at 11/12 riding Grok 4.5 launch + GPT-5.6 GA |
| ~~Prompt Compressor~~ (BUILT day 11, 2026-07-18) | `prompt-compressor` | Client-side prompt "token diet": paste a prompt, get a losslessly-compressed version with measured before/after token count + $ saved across models; serious counterpart to the trending "caveman" skill | pages | Won day 11 at 12/12 — reframed by JetBrains' 8.5%-on-agentic-work measurement from a cost calculator into a claim-verification instrument |
| ~~MCP Server Auditor~~ (BUILT day 7, 2026-07-13) | `mcp-auditor` | Paste an MCP server manifest/config: audit declared tool scopes, flag over-broad permissions, dangerous tool combos (filesystem+network = exfil path) and missing consent gates; the MCP-layer sibling to SkillScan | pages | Won day 7 at 10/12, riding continued `chrome-devtools-mcp` trending + `agentskills/agentskills` spec launch |
| Skill Conformance Checker | `skill-lint` | Validate a SKILL.md against the official `agentskills/agentskills` spec: required frontmatter fields, naming conventions, description-quality heuristics; correctness counterpart to SkillScan's security focus | pages | 2026-07-13 signal: `agentskills/agentskills` (official spec/docs repo) trending same day as its launch; scored 8/12, lost to MCP Auditor (10/12) — thematic overlap with SkillScan cost it on Distinctiveness |
| Foundry Model Board | `foundry-model-board` | Client-side comparison dashboard for models newly available on Azure AI Foundry (Claude, GPT, etc.) — pricing/context/capability filters | pages | 2026-07-13 signal: Claude models now available in Microsoft Foundry (Azure AI Foundry blog); scored 8/12, lost to MCP Auditor (10/12) — overlap risk with Token Cost Lab (day 4) |

## Refill rule
When ≤14 days remain, the weekly audit generates the next 30 ideas following the same arc: browser-demoable, Microsoft-stack, increasing ambition.

## Appended by the selection protocol (signal-derived ideas that scored >=8 but lost)
| Day added | Idea | Repo | Scope | Demo | Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | ~~Open Model Passport~~ (BUILT day 9, 2026-07-15) | `open-model-passport` | Pick an open/hosted model, get an instant "can I actually ship this?" report: licence terms, commercial use, weight availability, data residency, EU AI Act GPAI obligations. | pages | Won day 9 at 12/12 |
| 8 | AI Risk Tier Classifier | `ai-risk-tier` | Describe an AI use case, get its EU AI Act risk tier + the obligations that attach, fully client-side. Rides the UN Global Dialogue on AI Governance (Geneva, 6-7 Jul 2026) and China's CAC companion-AI rules (effective 15 Jul 2026). | pages | 9/12 |
| 9 | Blast Radius | `blast-radius` | Paste a shell/git command an agent wants to run and see a simulated blast-radius preview against a virtual filesystem: what gets destroyed, whether it is reversible, and a safer rewrite. Visual simulator rather than another rule-engine report card. | pages | 11/12 |
| 11 | Skill Portability Checker | `skill-portability` | Paste a SKILL.md and see which agents will actually run it — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenCode — checked against the `agentskills/agentskills` spec: required frontmatter, naming, and the vendor-specific extensions that silently break portability. | pages | 8/12 |
| 13 | RAG Injection Scanner | `rag-injection-scanner` | Paste the chunks a RAG pipeline retrieved and get an instant report of prompt-injection / instruction-override payloads hiding in the retrieved context ("ignore previous instructions", tool-call bait, exfiltration lures, zero-width smuggling) before they reach the model. Client-side rule engine, no model needed. | pages | 10/12 |
